## Welcome to my personal github repository

This website serves as an online reposity for:
* My current project portfolio
* A central listing of my professional experience
* A list of my publications

Here I will showcase some of the major data science projects I have worked on thus far. My areas of expertise include nuclear engineering, nuclear security, and nuclear forensics modeling.

### Bio:

Adam Drescher is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Nuclear Security Modeling Group of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Division at ORNL. Adam holds his B.S. in Physics, M.S. in Nuclear and Radiation Engineering, and Ph. D. in Nuclear and Radiation Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. His dissertation work developed machine learning models which can return the enrichment of an irradiated uranium specimen based off of its gamma-ray spectrum while remaining invariant across multiple unknown parameters. In addition to his dissertation work, Adam has research experience in neutron activation analysis, gamma-gamma coincidence detection, and nuclear fuel cycle modeling. He has presented his research at a number of nuclear engineering conferences in the United States and abroad. Throughout graduate school Adam was a fellow of the Consortium for Nonproliferation Enabling Capabilities.
