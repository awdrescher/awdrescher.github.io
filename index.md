## 1. [Predicting Uranium Enrichment With Simulated Data](SCALE_Predictions_Clean.ipynb)
This notebook takes simulated data of gamma-ray emissions from irradiated uranium of two isotopes (U-235 and U-238), from decay times ranging from one day to one year post-irradiation and builds predictive models which are capable of determining the enrichment of any sample with independence across decay time. This is important because conventional analytic techniques for enrichment determination rely on accurate decay time information.
