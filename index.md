## Welcome to my personal github repository

This website serves as an online portfolio and description of my professional background, major projects, publications, and conference proceedings. 

### Bio:

Adam Drescher is a Research & Development Program Manager in the Nonproliferation & Arms Control group at Y-12 National security complex. In this role, Adam writes, manages, executes, and documents R&D projects for the National Nuclear Security Administration. Adam's research primarily leverages data science and machine learning to develop algorithms that directly address current challenges relevant to national security. 

Prior to working at Y-12, Adam was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Nuclear Security Modeling Group of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Divsion at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In this role, Adam analyzed records in nuclear material control and accountability systems to identify erroneous transactions, developed statistical tests to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms, and developed an algorithm for piecewise regression models as an extension of conventional decision tree classifiers.

Adam holds his B.S. in Physics, M.S. in Nuclear and Radiation Engineering, and Ph. D. in Nuclear and Radiation Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. His dissertation work developed machine learning models which can estimate the enrichment of irradiated uranium specimens based off of emitted gamma-ray signatures without precisely constraining the decay time of those specimens. Throughout graduate school, Adam was a fellow of the Consortium for Nonproliferation Enabling Capabilities.
