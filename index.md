# About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin in the Nuclear and Radiation Engineering Program. My dissertation research utilizes data science and machine learning prediction techniques to characterize special nuclear materials which are important for nuclear safeguards and nuclear nonproliferation. 

In my free time I like to mess around with the data science tools I've gathered to tackle new problems.

[Here](Adam_Drescher_CV.pdf) is my CV.

## 1. [Classification Predictions of Uranium Enrichment With Real-World Experimental Data](CoincidenceModel_Clean.ipynb)
This notebook takes experimental gamma-ray measurements of uranium fission products I made during my Master's Thesis and creates classification models to discriminate between natural uranium, low-enriched uranium, and high-enriched uranium. These models are then used to determine which spectral features are most strongly correlated with uranium enrichment while being consistent across a one month range of decay times.

## 2. [Regression Predictions of Uranium Enrichment With Simulated Data](SCALE_Predictions_Clean.ipynb)
This notebook takes simulated data of gamma-ray emissions from irradiated uranium of two isotopes (U-235 and U-238), from decay times ranging from one day to one year post-irradiation and builds predictive models which are capable of determining the enrichment of any sample with independence across decay time. This is important because conventional analytic techniques for enrichment determination rely on accurate decay time information.
