## 1. [Classification Predictions of Uranium Enrichment With Real-World Experimental Data](Depracated/CoincidenceModel/CoincidenceModel_Clean.md)
This notebook takes experimental gamma-ray measurements of uranium fission products I made during my Master's Thesis and creates classification models to discriminate between natural uranium, low-enriched uranium, and high-enriched uranium. These models are then used to determine which spectral features are most strongly correlated with uranium enrichment while being consistent across a one month range of decay times.

## 2. [Classification and Regression Predictions of Uranium Enrichment With Simulated Data](Depracated/SCALE_05_2019/SCALE_05_08_2019.md)
This notebook builds classification and regression models for the determination of uranium and plutonium based on gamma-ray signatures across ranges of decay times. The simulated data of gamma-ray emissions is from irradiated uranium and plutonium (isotopes U-235, U-238, Pu-239, and Pu-240), from 180 decay times ranging from zero to eighteen days post-irradiation. This is important because conventional analytic techniques for enrichment determination rely on accurate decay time information. Furthermore, the developed models are capable of discerning new features within the data which are indicative of the actinide of interest, thus improving on the state-of-the-art methods for actinide determination in irradiated matrices.

## 3. [Front to Back Example Data Science Project](Depracated/StateFarm/StateFarm.md)
This notebook explains and performs all of the major steps necessary to build robust machine learning models. A large dataset full of missing values, typos, etc. containing both numerical and categorical data is analyzed in a binary classification task. The steps necessary for data preparation including data cleansing, scaling, and imputing are performed and explained. Then, multiple classification models are fine-tuned via grid searches and the performance of different algorithms is compared. The final model obtains a score (measured via receiver operating characteristic area under curve) of over 0.98.

# About Me

Adam Drescher is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Nuclear Security Modeling Group of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Division at ORNL. Adam holds his B.S. in Physics, M.S. in Nuclear and Radiation Engineering, and Ph. D. in Nuclear and Radiation Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. His dissertation work developed machine learning models which can return the enrichment of an irradiated uranium specimen based off of its gamma-ray spectrum while remaining invariant across multiple unknown parameters. In addition to his dissertation work, Adam has research experience in neutron activation analysis, gamma-gamma coincidence detection, and nuclear fuel cycle modeling. He has presented his research at a number of nuclear engineering conferences in the United States and abroad. He also held two summer internships at ORNL in 2016 and 2017. Throughout graduate school Adam was a fellow of the Consortium for Nonproliferation Enabling Capabilities
